# 👋 Hi, I'm James!

I'm a cybersecurity engineer and hobbyist hardware designer with a particular passion for **mechanical keyboards**.
While I do also sell my excess keyboard stock over on Etsy, your more than welcome to grab the schematics from here for personal use.

## 🧠 What You Can Find Here

- ⚙️ PCB Schematics for all my designs
- 🛠️ Keyboard Firmware for each of my keyboards along with build guides
- 📦 And maybe some odd scripts which I've chosen to make public

## 💬 Let's Connect

If you’re into keyboard design, cybersecurity, or just want to talk about keyboard layouts or switches, feel free to reach out.
